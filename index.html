      In the corner of the morning in the past
      <br>
      I would sit and blame the master first and last
      <br>
      All the roads were straight and narrow
      <br>
      And the prayers were small and yellow
      <br>
      And the rumour spread that I was aging fast
      <br>
      Then I ran across a monster who was sleeping 
      <br>
      By a tree
      <br>
      And I looked and frowned and the monster was me
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      Well, I said hello and I said hello
      <br>
      And I asked, why not, and I replied, I don't know
      <br>
      So we asked a simple black bird, who was happy as can be
      <br>
      And he laughed insane and quipped Kahlil Gibran
      <br>
      And I cried for all the others till the day was nearly through
      <br>
      For I realized that God's a young man too
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      Ho
      Oh I said so long and I waved bye-bye
      <br>
      And I smashed my soul and traded my mind
      <br>
      Got laid by a young bordello
      <br>
      Who was vaguely half asleep
      <br>
      For which my reputation swept back home in drag
      <br>
      And the moral of this magic spell
      <br>
      Negotiates my hide
      <br>
      When God did take my logic for a ride
      <br>
      (Riding along)
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
      <br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      He swallowed his pride and puckered his lips
      <br>
      And showed me the leather belt round his hips
      <br>
      My knees were shaking my cheeks aflame
      <br>
      He said you'll never go down to the Gods again
      <br>
      (Turn around, go back)
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      He struck the ground a cavern appeared
      <br>
      And I smelt the burning pit of fear
      <br>
      We crashed a thousand yards below
      <br>
      I said do it again, do it again
      <br>
      (Turn around, go back)
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      His nebulous body swayed above
      <br>
      His tongue swollen with devil's love
      <br>
      The snake and I, a venom high
      <br>
      I said do it again, do it again
      <br>
      (Turn around, go back)
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply
      <br>
      And I was seething, breathing deeply
      <br>
      Spitting sentry, horned and tailed
      <br>
      Waiting for you, oh
    </div>
    <div class="lyrics">
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
      <br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
